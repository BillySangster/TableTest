# TableTest
Attempting to implement a pop-up button menu in a view-based NSTableView
I can't get the bindings to work on the pop-up menu. Have a go, if you have a few minutes to spare.
The project should be self-explantatory (I hope).  
WARNING: At the moment, most times I attempt this it hangs Xcode and eventually forces a restart of the computer (it heats up). :(
